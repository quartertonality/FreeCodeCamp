      <p class="story"> I discovered the music of Charles Ives in 2002 when I was in my first year at SUNY Fredonia taking a class in the History of American Music while working toward a Bachelor's degree in Music Composition.</p>
      <p class="story"> The more I learned about his life, and the more I listened to his music the more important he became to me. I would argue that, not only is he my favorite composer, but he may be the <em>best</em> American composer to ever live.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 id="facts">Some quick facts about his life</h2>
    <ul class="story">
      <li>Born in 1874 in Danbury, Connecticut</li>
      <li>Studied music composition at Yale under Horatio Parker</li>
      <li>Made his fortune not through music, but in the insurance business</li>
      <Li>His works include 4 symphonies, 2 string quartets, 114 songs, 4 violin sonatas, 2 piano sonatas, among many other notable works</li>
      <li>Though his works were largely ignored during his lifetime Leonard Bernstein was among the first to champion his music</li>
      <li>Awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Music in 1947 for his Symphony No. 3</li>
    </ul>

      <h2 id="music" algin=left>Music</h2>
      <p class="story">Ives' music was, and sometimes still is, considered "difficult." Often times multiple ideas overlap; sometimes in different keys, or different tempi, or different time signatures, or sometimes all of the above. Ives often borrows heavily from hymns, folk tunes, and war songs; he'll often incorporate quotes and use them as a jumping off point, or heavily embellish them with chord clusters and improvisatory flourishes.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="story">Ives was influenced heavily by his own New England upbringing, and by his father's work with a military band. Though Charles never fought in the war, he strived to capture the sound of an Army band and other rememberances from his childhood in his music. His use of multiple songs at the same time came from memories of hearing different marching bands practicing simultaneously, while his fascination with quartertones evolved from attempting to capture the sound of ringing church bells.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="story">Personally, the pieces that most resonate with me are his 2nd Symphony, his orchestral sets, and his 3 pieces for quartertone pianos. I specifically remember hearing Joel Sachs and Cheryl Seltzer performing the quartertone piano pieces as part of a performance with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(chamber_ensemble)">Continuum</a> ensemble at King Concert Hall at SUNY Fredonia. I was learning about Ives' music for the first time in my American Music History class that very same semester, and the Continuum performance was my first <em>live</em> introduction to his music. Needless to say, I was blown away.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="story">It's not very often that one gets to hear sounds that they have never heard before, but that night I did.
